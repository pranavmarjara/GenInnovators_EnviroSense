Revamp the Solar Intelligence page so that after the user clicks “Analyze Solar”, the empty right-side panel transforms into a structured Solar Intelligence Report.

Post-Calculation Requirements:

1. Solar Verdict (Top of Result Panel)
- Display a clear decision statement:
  “Solar installation is recommended for your location”
  OR
  “Solar installation is not optimal for your location”
- Use a check or warning icon.
- Keep language confident and simple.

2. Recommended Solar System Summary
Show the following clearly:
- Recommended number of panels (example: 5 panels)
- Estimated system size (example: 2.5 kW)
- Percentage of daily energy offset (example: ~80%)

This section should be text-first, not chart-heavy.

3. Solar Panel Specifications (Educational, Not Salesy)
Display a small specs card with realistic, generic values:
- Panel type: Monocrystalline
- Power per panel: ~500 W
- Efficiency: ~20%
- Lifespan: 25 years
- Maintenance level: Low

Clarify that these are standard reference specifications, not brand-specific.

4. Why This Recommendation (Decision Explanation)
Add a short explanation block:
“This recommendation is based on your region’s sunlight availability, air quality impact on panel efficiency, and your average daily energy usage.”

This section is mandatory — it explains the decision.

5. Environmental & Cost Impact (Compact)
Display:
- Estimated annual CO₂ reduction (example: ~1.8 tons)
- Estimated annual electricity bill savings (example: ₹61,000 / year)

Do not include NSS branding here. Keep it neutral.

6. UI / Interaction Rules
- The right panel should remain empty until calculation.
- After calculation, content should fade or slide in.
- Maintain the existing Solar Intelligence visual style.
- No images, no brand logos, no external links.

Goal:
Turn the Solar Calculator into a Solar Intelligence Report that helps users understand:
1) Whether solar is worth it
2) How many panels they need
3) What kind of panels are typically used
4) Why the recommendation was made
