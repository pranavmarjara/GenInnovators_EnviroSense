Revamp the existing Dashboard to align with EnviroSense’s current role as a decision-support and environmental intelligence platform.

Dashboard Role:
The Dashboard should function as an orientation and summary screen, not a marketing or landing page. It must help users quickly understand their environmental context, current progress, and what action to take next.

Layout & Content Changes:

1. Remove / De-emphasize Marketing Hero
- Remove or significantly reduce the large hero section (“Get closer to nature”).
- Replace it with a concise header:
  “Your Environmental Snapshot”
- Subtext:
  “Based on your location and current selections”

2. Environmental Snapshot (Top Section)
Group existing metrics (AQI, CO₂, Humidity) under a single card titled:
“Today’s Environment”

Add a short interpretation line below the metrics, such as:
“Conditions today are favorable for outdoor activity and solar generation.”

This interpretation must be text-based, not color-only.

3. Core Action Summary Cards (Primary Dashboard Content)
Replace the existing feature cards with three action-oriented summary cards:

a) Solar Status Card
- Title: “Solar Intelligence”
- Content:
  “Solar installation is recommended for your region”
  “Estimated energy offset: ~70–80%”
- CTA Button: “View Solar Intelligence”

b) Your Garden Card
- Title: “Your Garden”
- Content:
  “Plants selected: X”
  “Estimated CO₂ absorption: ~Y–Z kg/year”
- CTA Button: “View Your Garden”

c) Green Credits Card
- Title: “Green Credits Awareness”
- Content:
  “Eligible environmental actions identified”
  “Learn how citizens can participate”
- CTA Button: “Explore Green Credits”

4. “What You Can Do Next” Section
Add a short guidance section with 3 bullet points:
- “Check if solar is worth it for your home”
- “Choose plants suited to your lifestyle”
- “Understand how Green Credits work”

This section is informational only and helps guide user flow.

5. Daily Tip (Retain, Reposition)
Keep the Daily Tip feature but move it under a header:
“Small Actions, Real Impact”

Do not overemphasize it visually.

6. Design Guidelines
- Maintain the Solar Intelligence visual language (dark theme, calm cards, soft highlights).
- Avoid large decorative illustrations.
- Prioritize clarity, readable text, and meaningful numbers.
- This dashboard should feel like a control panel, not a brochure.

Goal:
Ensure the dashboard immediately communicates:
1) What EnviroSense does
2) The user’s current environmental context
3) The next meaningful action the user can take
